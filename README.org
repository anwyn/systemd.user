* Alsa,Jack, Pulseaudio and Systemd User Sessions

  This is the setup for my hardware:

  - Card 1 :: Motherboard, HD Audio (ALC 1220) 
  - Card 2 :: USB, Rocksmith Guitar Adapter
  - Card 3 :: USB, Focusrite Scarlet 8i6

* Jack

  In case jack can not switch to realtime mode when started from a
  user session systemd service, but does it just fine from the X11
  session dbus, check if /etc/pam.d/systemd-user contains the line

: session required pam_limits.so

  
* Pulseaudio

  I want Pulsaudio for the ease of integrating non Jack-aware desktop
  applications. It is bridged to Jack via module-jack-source and module-jack-sink.
  Pulseaudio can not set realtime scheduling for the jack modules,
  there is an open issue for this in the bugtracker.
